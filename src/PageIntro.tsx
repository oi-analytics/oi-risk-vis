      <h1>Southeast Asia Infrastructure Risk Prototype</h1>
      <p>
        This prototype tool presents infrastructure risk analytics for
        South-East Asia (SEA) using open-data sources on fluvial and coastal
        flooding hazard maps along with cyclone hazard maps. The risks are
        analysed and visualised for power plants, electricity transmission
        lines, road networks, railway networks, ports and airports in SEA. The
        analysis has been undertaken for the World Bank by Oxford Infrastructure
        Analytics Ltd.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of the prototype is to illustrate the type and nature of
        simulation results and network data currently available in the SEA
        region, and how &ndash; using the existing toolchain &ndash; this data
        might be accessed and interrogated at a sub-national, national or
        super-national scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        The modelling and analysis presented here aim to support Disaster Risk
        Finance and Insurance (DRFI) decision-making by identifying spatial
        criticalities and risks under current and future hazard scenarios. It
        comprises a direct damage estimation and an indirect economic loss
        estimation of GDP disruptions due to asset failures and service
        disruption.
